			<article id="content"><h1 id="whoiam">who i am</h1>
				<p>I am a master student Embedded Software based in the Netherlands. Most of my time is spent tinkering with electronics, doing schoolwork and recreational programming. I'm a massive robotics enthusiast and have had the luck of meeting other who share this passion.</p>
				<p>I have a decent collection of musical instruments, most of which i don't know how to play with the exception of a few, most notably the trombone and bass guitar.</p>
				<p>Most evenings you can find me at the bar at my student association.</p>
				<h1 id="whatido">what i do</h1>
				<ul>
				<li>I'm currently following the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/es/msc-embedded-systems/">Embedded Systems</a> masters programme at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>. In 2020 I was admitted the Computer Science and Engineering bachelors degree at the same university.</li>
				<li>Since july 2020 I've been working as an embedded systems engineer and full stack web developer at <a href="https://www.aquablu.com/en/">Aquablu</a>, Voorhout.</li>
				<li>From 2017 until 2020 I've had a part-time job as a web developer at <a href="https://happyflow.io/">HappyFlow</a>, the Hague.</li>
				<li>I have done a <a href="https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/robot-minor-super-intensief-voor-studenten">minor</a> in robotics. During this minor we built a life-size interactive robotic guide named IONA for the Science Centre, Delft.</li>
				<li>In the past I have competed in the <a href="https://robocupjunior.nl">RoboCupJunior</a> national and world championships, of which i won the former. Nowadays I am on <a href="https://www.robocupjunior.nl/organisatie/">the board</a> that organizes this national championship.</li>
				<li>Together with a team consisting of university personnel and students I am working on a robotics platform to help teach high schoolers the art of programming.</li>
				<li>I am a member of the <a href="https://ngrsa.nl/">Robotics Study Association</a> (RSA) that aims to connect students in the robotics community to the industry.</li>
				<li>For my final bachelor thesis I have worked on <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Acaa6b17a-b94f-471c-aa22-985587f71416">computer vision software</a> for warehouse based flying drones at <a href="https://www.eonics.nl/inbox/team-airwolf-studeert-af-op-barcode-herkenning-voor-drones/">Eonics</a>, the Hague.</li>
				<li>Ever since the first day of my student live I have been a member of <a href="https://debolk.nl/">De Bolk</a>, a student association with no purpose other than having fun. This is a great place for me to work on some programming projects because there are a lot of people to test my software on.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1 id="quickwords">quick words</h1>
				<p>I like to play around with provided assets like images and documents. However, I do not own licenses to the Microsoft and/or Adobe software that is often required for these kinds of things. FOSS software is often enough for me. I wish more assets were provided in non-proprietary file formats.</p>
				<p>I disagree with the notion that newer is always better. There is a time and place for everything, but when your web page takes a full minute to load you must reassess your priorities. Besides, I really love the look of simple websites that don't have too much going on.</p>
				<p>Tabs are always better than spaces, except for aligning stuff. Linux kernel style is the only proper way to place brackets. Vim is better than Emacs, but only because no one except Richard bothers with the steep learning curve. I prefer Gnome over KDE. You can be an expert on any programming language and still dislike said language.</p>
				<p>Here be dragons.</p>
