				<h1 id="whoiam">who i am</h1>
				<p>I am a software developer based in the Netherlands. I love working with embedded software and have a few years of full-stack development under my belt. Most of my time is spent tinkering with electronics, recreational programming and side projects. I'm a massive robotics enthusiast and have had the luck of meeting others who share this passion.</p>
				<p>I have a decent collection of musical instruments, most of which i don't know how to play. The exception being the trombone and bass guitar.</p>
				<h1 id="whatido">what i do</h1>
				<ul>
				<li>I have followed the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/es/msc-embedded-systems/">Embedded Systems</a> masters programme at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">Delft University of Technology</a>, but about halfway through I decided to pursue a full-time career instead. In 2020 I was admitted the Computer Science and Engineering bachelors degree at the same university.</li>
				<li>Since july 2020 I've been working as an embedded systems engineer and full stack web developer at <a href="https://www.aquablu.com/en/">Aquablu</a>, Amsterdam. At first as a part-timer but I have been employed full-time since march 2022.</li>
				<li>From 2017 until 2020 I've had a part-time job as a web developer at <a href="https://happyflow.io/">HappyFlow</a>, the Hague.</li>
				<li>I have finished a <a href="https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/robot-minor-super-intensief-voor-studenten">minor</a> in robotics. During this minor we built a life-size interactive robotic guide named IONA for the Science Centre, Delft.</li>
				<li>In the past I have competed in the <a href="https://robocupjunior.nl">RoboCupJunior</a> national and world championships, of which i won the former. Nowadays I am on <a href="https://www.robocupjunior.nl/organisatie/">the board</a> that organizes this national championship.</li>
				<li>Together with a team consisting of university personnel and students I am working on a robotics platform to help teach highschoolers the art of programming.</li>
				<li>I am a member of the <a href="https://rsadelft.nl/">Robotics Study Association</a> (RSA) that aims to connect students in the robotics community to the industry.</li>
				<li>For my final bachelor thesis I have worked on <a href="https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3Acaa6b17a-b94f-471c-aa22-985587f71416">computer vision software</a> for warehouse based flying drones at <a href="https://www.eonics.nl/inbox/team-airwolf-studeert-af-op-barcode-herkenning-voor-drones/">Eonics</a>, the Hague.</li>
				<li>Ever since the first day of my student live I have been a member of <a href="https://debolk.nl/">De Bolk</a>, a student association with no purpose other than having fun. This is a great place for me to work on some programming projects because there are a lot of people to test my software on.</li>
				</ul>
				<h1 id="quickwords">quick words</h1>
				<p>I like to play around with provided assets like images and documents; however, I do not own licenses to the criminally expensive subscription based software suites that are often required for these kinds of files. I wish more assets were provided in non-proprietary file formats.</p>
				<p>I disagree with the notion that newer is always better. There is a time and place for everything, but when your web page takes a full minute to load you must reassess your priorities. Besides, I really love the look of simple websites that don't have too much going on.</p>
				<p>Any competent programmer should be comfortable using multiple programming languages for the same reason a carpenter should be comfortable using multiple types of tools. Hammering a nail using a wrench is equivalent to writing a web server in C or a kernel driver in PHP.</p>
				<p>Brackets are placed in Suns variant of the K&amp;R indentation style. Vim is better than Emacs, simply because it doesn't require a bachelors degree in wasting time to figure out. I prefer Gnome over KDE because I dislike overly complex setting panels. You can be an expert on any programming language and still dislike said language.</p>
